 *  Package that contains the information and algorithgms to schedule the network.                                     *

 *  The scheduler is also responsible to find the the paths that the frames have to follow to arrive to its            *
 *  destination.                                                                                                       *

/**
 Produces the schedule solving all constraints in one call to the Solver for a given network.
 It inits the solver and the network.
 It starts creating all the constraints (one variable for each transmission offset), then adds constraints relating
 different offsets. At the end solves the logical context and the model obtained is the solver.
 It creates an xml file with the output schedule.
 It also creates different constraint files for every switch in the network containing specific constraints for each
 switch
